    <h2>Ars Futura</h2>
    <p>
        I co-founded Ars Futura with a friend back in 2013 when I was 22 years
        old. Today, Ars Futura has
        <em>25 employees</em> and we have worked with more than
        <em>30 clients</em> from all around the world, building mobile and web
        apps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our clients range from small startups, established agencies to large
        corporations. We have worked with
        <em>Activision Blizzard</em> and their subsidiary
        <a href="http://mlg.com/" target="_blank">Major League Gaming</a>
        to bring esports to millions of people around the world. With a little
        help from us,
        <a href="https://elementalmachines.io/" target="">Elemental Machines</a>
        is revolutionizing science-based industries with powerful, data-driven
        insights. We partnered with
        <a href="https://miturf.com/" target="_blank">MITURF</a> to build the
        best way to discover and book sporting spaces. And we're working with
        <a href="https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"
            >Harvard</a
        >
        on technology that powers their innovation incubator.

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>
        Reading is something that lets me relax from a long day working, and
        often provides me with a different outlook on life and experiences.
    </p>
    {% assign books = site.data.reading | where:"is_reading","true" %}
    {% if books.size > 0 %}
    <p>This is what I'm currently reading:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for book in books %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ book.link }}" target="_blank">{{ book.title }}</a>
            by <em>{{ book.author }}</em>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% else %}
    <p><em>I'm not actively reading anything at the moment.</em> ðŸ˜¢ <a href="https://twitter.com/bozicivan" target="_blank">Tweet at me</a> if you have any suggestions!</p>
    {% endif %}
    <p>Here are some books that I recently read:</p>
    {% assign books = site.data.reading | where:"is_reading","false" | limit: 3
    %}
    <ul>
        {% for i in (0..5) %} {% assign book = books[i] %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ book.link }}" target="_blank">{{ book.title }}</a>
            by <em>{{ book.author }}</em>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <p>
        Mostly for my sake, I've started collecting the books I've read into a
        separate page on this website dedicated just for that. If you're
        interested, head on over to the
        <a href="/reading/">Reading &rarr;</a> page.
