<p>Hello friend and welcome! My name is Ivan and I'm a founder living in Zagreb, Croatia.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, I have been a software engineer, designer, product manager, founder, CEO, and everything in between. <em>Jack of all trades, master of some.</em></p>
<p>I am a husband to a wonderful wife and a father to a beautiful girl. I love driving cars and watching them go round in circles for hours on end. A few years ago I picked up a cocktail shaker and discovered a passion for mixology. My favorite cocktail is a Negroni.</p>

<h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
<h3>Ars Futura</h3>
<p>In 2013, I founded <a href="https://arsfutura.com/">Ars Futura</a>, a software company. Since then, Ars Futura grew to 50+ people. Along the way, I had the privilege of working with some amazing people.</p>
<p>We have worked with <a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/">Activision Blizzard</a> to bring esports to millions of people. With our help, <a href="https://elementalmachines.io/">Elemental Machines</a> is revolutionizing science-based industries with powerful, data-driven insights. <a href="https://evisort.com/">Evisort</a> is on a mission to automate the entire contracting process. <a href="https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> uses our technology to power their innovation incubator, and <a href="https://www.bevi.co/">Bevi</a> even appeared on HBO's Silicon Valley.</p>
<h3>PontaHR</h3>
<p>I am the founder of <a href="https://pontahr.com/">PontaHR</a>, a hiring tool built for growing teams. As we scaled Ars Futura, we wanted something that was built for companies such as ours.</p>
<p>PontaHR is simple, intuitive, powerful, and customizable. Right now, we are invested heavily into bringing AI agents to work inside of PontaHR. The future of PontaHR is in expanding to cover all aspects of people management &ndash; a PeopleOS.</p>
<h3>Pincone</h3>
<p>Simply put, <a href="https://pincone.com/">Pincone</a> is a bookmarking tool. But it's a lot more than that! You can bookmark links. You can also subscribe to RSS feeds. And you can create unique email addresses and use them to subscribe to newsletters!</p>
<p>The next big thing I want to add to Pincone is the ability to add <em>any</em> type of content. Images, videos, files, notes. To hold everything and anything you find interesting.</p>
<p>I use Pincone every day and it's something that keeps me away from doomscrolling my day on socials. I am building it myself, for myself. And it's wonderful to see other people resonating with that and using it themselves.</p>
