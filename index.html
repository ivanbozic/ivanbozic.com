    <h2>Ars Futura</h2>
    <p>
        I co-founded Ars Futura with a friend back in 2013 when I was 22 years old. Today, Ars Futura has <em>26 employees</em> and we have worked with more than <em>30 clients</em> from all around the world, building mobile and web apps.
    </p>

        Our clients range from small startups, established agencies to large corporations. We have worked with <a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/">Activision Blizzard</a> and their subsidiary <em>Major League Gaming</em> to bring esports to millions of people around the world. With a little help from us, <a href="https://elementalmachines.io/">Elemental Machines</a> is revolutionizing science-based industries with powerful, data-driven insights. <a href="https://evisort.com/">Evisort</a> is out there on a mission to automate the entire contracting process. We're working with <a href="https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a> on technology that powers their innovation incubator, and <a href="https://www.bevi.co/">Bevi</a> even appeared on HBO's Silicon Valley.

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>
        Reading is something that lets me relax from a long day working, and
        often provides me with a different outlook on life and experiences.
    </p>
    {% assign books = site.data.reading | where:"is_reading","true" %}
    {% if books.size > 0 %}
    <p>This is what I'm currently reading:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for book in books %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ book.link }}">{{ book.title }}</a>
            by <em>{{ book.author }}</em>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% else %}
    <p><em>I'm not actively reading anything at the moment.</em> ðŸ˜¢ <a href="https://twitter.com/bozicivan">Tweet at me</a> if you have any suggestions!</p>
    {% endif %}
    <p>Here are some books that I recently read:</p>
    {% assign books = site.data.reading | where:"is_reading","false" | limit: 3
    %}
    <ul>
        {% for i in (0..5) %} {% assign book = books[i] %}
        <li>
            <a href="{{ book.link }}">{{ book.title }}</a>
            by <em>{{ book.author }}</em>
        </li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <p>
        Mostly for my sake, I've started collecting the books I've read into a
        separate page on this website dedicated just for that. If you're
        interested, head on over to the
        <a href="/reading/">Reading &rarr;</a> page.
