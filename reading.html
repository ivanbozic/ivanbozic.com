        I love reading. Reading is something that can open up a world of new
        experiences, ideas and change your entire outlook on some things in
        life. For the past two years, I've started reading a lot more
        biographies, travel essays and non-fiction books in general.

        I started writing down the books I've read on this website on February
        19th, 2018. Lately, I've started jotting down some notes while I'm
        reading a book or after I've read it. Where it makes sense, I'll try and
        include those next to the books themselves.
